Okay, treasure hunter! Let's explore another treasure map (quadratic equation)! We will work with the example: `$x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$`. We'll solve it just like before.

**Step 1: Find a, b, and c**

Remember our map looks like this: `$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$`.

From our example `$x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0$`, we can see:

*   `$a = 1$` (because `$x^2$` is the same as `$1x^2$`)
*   `$b = -6$`
*   `$c = 9$`

**Step 2: Use the Quadratic Formula (Our Trusty GPS)**

To find the treasure (roots), we'll again use the quadratic formula:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

**Step 3: Plug in the Values (Following the GPS)**

Let's put our `$a$`, `$b$`, and `$c$` values into the formula:

$$ x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 9}}{2 \cdot 1} $$

**Step 4: Simplify (Digging Carefully!)**

Now, we simplify the equation:

$$ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 36}}{2} $$

$$ x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2} $$

$$ x = \frac{6 \pm 0}{2} $$

**Step 5: Find the Treasure (Root)**

We have one solution because the `$\pm$` part becomes zero:

*   `$x = \frac{6 + 0}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$`
*   `$x = \frac{6 - 0}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$`

**So, the treasure (root) is `$x = 3$`.** It is the same for both roots! This means `$x_1 = 3$` and `$x_2 = 3$`.

**What kind of treasure did we find?**

Let's look at the discriminant `$b^2 - 4ac$`.

In our problem `$b^2 - 4ac = 0$`.

*   Since the discriminant is equal to 0, we know the roots are real and equal! Think of finding two identical gems at the same spot. It is simply `$x = -\frac{b}{2a}$`.

You found the treasure again! Are you ready for the next adventure?
