Okay, let's become treasure hunters using this text! It's like we have a message that leads us to the location of lost treasure, and this time, it tells us how to graph a treasure map!

**Step 1: The Treasure Clue**

The text gives us the clue: `$-x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0$`. This is a secret code we need to solve to find the treasure.

**Step 2: Make the Treasure Map**

The text tells us to make a treasure map using this equation: `$y = -x^2 + 3x - 2$`. This is the map that leads us to the treasure!

**Step 3: Find the Spots**

The table in the text shows us different spots on the map. For example, at location `$x = 0$`, the table tells us our height is `$y = -2$`. At location `$x = 1$`, our height is `$y = 0$`. These spots help us draw the map to find the treasure!

*   `$x$` : 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3
*   `$y$` : -2, -0.75, 0, 0.25, 0, -0.75, -2

This is like our list of spots where we think the treasures will be located!

**Step 4: Where Map touches the ground**

We know that we have the information to create our map. With this map we know where the treasure is located!

The text tells us that the graph crosses the `$X$$-axis (ground) at `(1, 0)` and `(2, 0)`. These are the secret locations where the treasure is buried!

**Solution to the treasure locations**

*   `$x = 1$`
*   `$x = 2$`

**In Treasure Hunter Terms**

*   Secret Clue: `$-x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0$`.
*   Map of the treasure island: `$y = -x^2 + 3x - 2$`.
*   Spots to dig:
    *   `$x = 1$`
    *   `$x = 2$`
