Okay! We're still finding the "gender" of words like detectives! Remember how "teachers" was Common Gender?

Now, let's look at "Mr. Rahman," like you said!

* **"Mr. Rahman"** in the story is a man. Remember, like we said before, masculine gender is like saying "boy" or "man."

So, what "gender" is "Mr. Rahman"?

Think about it... is he a boy/man (Masculine)? A girl/woman (Feminine)? Could it be either (Common)? Or is it not a person (Neuter)?
