Okay! Let's learn about the text you sent me. It says:

"**moderate** -- in between 26--28 degree. Unlike England there is no rain, no"

Here's the fun and easy way to understand it:

1.  **Moderate means "not too much"**: Imagine you're making a smoothie. "Moderate" sweetness means you don't add *too* much sugar. Just the right amount! It's not super sweet, but not bland either.

2.  **Temperature is 26-28 degrees (Celsius)**: The text talks about a temperature between 26 and 28 degrees. Think of it like this: it's a warm day! Not super hot like being in the desert (fantastic! It's not at all!), but warm enough to wear shorts and a t-shirt.

3.  **No Rain (unlike England)**: England is known for a lot of rain. The text says it's *not* like that here. So, you probably won't need your umbrella!

4.  **Using our blocks** Pretend our tower is in that temperature. It's warm enough for us to enjoy building the tower. And because it's not raining , our blocks are not going to get wet
