Okay! We're still learning about "Gender" with our superhero dance party, like before!

The new text gives us the *names* of the boy/man superheroes (masculine forms) that need dance partners! It's like a list of superheroes waiting to be matched up with their female counterparts!

**Think of it like this:**

Each word in this list is a boy/man superhero. We need to find the matching girl/woman superhero from another list (which we don't have yet!). It's like a puzzle. We know the boy/man and need to find the correct girl/woman!

Here's what the text is telling us:

"Masculine" - This is just a title. It means these are *all* the boy/man superheroes we need to find partners for.
"Form"- this refers to the type of superhero we are talking about. Example- Lion

**Story Time!**

Imagine a big superhero ball (party)!

All the boy/man superheroes are standing on one side of the room. They're waiting for their partners to come. Our job is to know *who* they are so we can find their dance partners!

So, the text is just listing the boy/man superheroes that need to be matched!

Remember, this activity is focused on boy/man and girl/woman pairs. As we have talked before, gender is more than just boy and girl. But this is a fun way to learn about pairs!
