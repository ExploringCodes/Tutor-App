Okay! You want me to explain the four genders in English from the text, right? And make it fun! We can do that. Remember how we talked about labels on words like toys? Let's use that idea.

**Step 1: Remembering the Labels!**

Before, we found labels for man and woman/boy and girl. Like **Mr. Rahman** (male) and **wife** (female).

**Step 2: The Four Labels (Genders)!** The text says there are four labels:

1.  **Masculine gender:** This is like the "boy" label. Words like "king," "actor," and "he" have this label. It means they are usually talking about men or boys.

2.  **Feminine gender:** This is like the "girl" label. Words like "queen," "actress," and "she" have this label. It means they are usually talking about women or girls.

3.  **Common gender:** Remember how "teachers" could be men or women? This label is for words that can be *either* male or female. Like "friend," "teacher," "doctor," or even "parent". It doesn't pick one, it can be both!

4.  **Neuter gender:** This is a new label! It's for things that are *not* alive, or things we don't usually think of as having a gender (male or female). Things like "table," "book," "car," or "sky." These words don't have boy or girl labels. They have a "neuter" label. **Neuter** means 'neither' male nor female.

**Step 3: Let's Play Labeling Game!**

I'll give you a word. You tell me which label (gender) it has: masculine, feminine, common, or neuter.

Ready? How about "chair?"
