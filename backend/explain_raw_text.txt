Okay, let's solve the quadratic equation `$3 - 4x - x^2 = 0$` from your text! We'll make it a fun adventure, like finding hidden treasure.

**Step 1: Tidy Up the Room!**

First, let's rearrange the equation so it looks more familiar. We want it in the form `$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$`. So, let's rewrite it as:

`$-x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$`

**Step 2: Meet the Treasure Hunters (a, b, c)!**

Remember our movie cast from before? We need to identify `a`, `b`, and `c` again:

*   `a`: The number in front of `$x^2$`. Here, `a = -1`.
*   `b`: The number in front of `x`. Here, `b = -4`.
*   `c`: The lonely number. So, `c = 3`.

**Step 3: The Discriminant's Secret Hideout!**

Like before, the discriminant `$b^2 - 4ac$` is important. Let's find it:

`$(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot (-1) \cdot 3 = 16 + 12 = 28$`

So, the discriminant is 28. It's like a clue that tells us how many solutions we'll find.

**Step 4: The Quadratic Formula Map!**

Time to use our formula (the map to the treasure):

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

**Step 5: Filling in the Map (Plugging in a, b, c)!**

Let's put in our values for `a`, `b`, and `c`:

$$ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot (-1) \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot (-1)} $$

**Step 6: Simplify the Route!**

Let's make it easier to read:

$$ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{28}}{-2} $$

**Step 7: Unlocking the Square Root!**

We can simplify `$\sqrt{28}$` because 28 = 4 * 7, and the square root of 4 is 2:

$$ x = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{7}}{-2} $$

**Step 8: Almost There! (Final Simplification)**

Now, let's divide everything by -2:

$$ x = -2 \pm -\sqrt{7} $$
$$ x = -2 \pm \sqrt{7} $$

**Step 9: The Treasure! (Our Two Solutions)**

We found the two solutions!

*   `$x_1 = -2 - \sqrt{7}$`
*   `$x_2 = -2 + \sqrt{7}$`

**So, the solutions to `$3 - 4x - x^2 = 0$` are `$x = -2 - \sqrt{7}$` and `$x = -2 + \sqrt{7}$`.** Congratulations, treasure hunter!
