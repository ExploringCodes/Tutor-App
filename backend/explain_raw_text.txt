Okay! We're still learning about "Gender" in a fun way, like we talked about before. Now, let's look at this new text:

**A.** **Gender is a distinction which shows whether a noun or pronoun is male or female. It is related to the sex of living beings.**

**What does this mean?**

*   Think of nouns (name) and pronouns (he, she, it) like people's names and how we talk about them. This text says gender is like a label (tag) that tells us if the person is a boy (male) or a girl (female).
*   "Sex of living beings" means if someone is born a boy or a girl.

**Let's use the toy box again:**

Imagine you have dolls. You might say "She is pretty." "She" is a pronoun, and it tells us the doll is seen as a girl (female). If you have a toy car, you might say "It is fast!" "It" is a pronoun.

**Story Time!**

Imagine a school. The text says:

**All the teachers were invited to the party. Their spouses (husband or wife) and children were also invited. But Mr. Rahman could not attend the party, because his wife was ill. As his son and daughter were away from home, there was nobody else in the house to look after her.**

Let's find the genders!

*   **Mr. Rahman:** He is a man, so his gender is male (boy).
*   **Wife:** She is a woman, so her gender is female (girl).
*   **Son:** He is a boy, so his gender is male.
*   **Daughter:** She is a girl, so her gender is female.

**Important!** Remember what we learned before. This text mostly talks about if someone is male or female. The important thing to remember is that gender is also about how you feel inside, not just if you are a boy or a girl at birth. Everyone is different!
