Okay! Let's do Activity 1! It's like a fill-in-the-blanks game to learn about the "boy," "girl," "both," and "neither" labels for words! We will use our memory from the previous chat to help us solve it

1.  **The masculine gender denotes a \_\_ person or animal.**

   *   This is asking: What kind of person or animal is "masculine"? Remember "Mr. Rahman" and "son" from our story? They were boys or men!

   *   **Answer:** The masculine gender denotes a **male** person or animal. (Male means "boy" or "man").

2.  **The feminine gender refers to a \_\_ person or animal.**

    *   This is asking: What kind of person or animal is "feminine"? Think about "wife" and "daughter" from our story. They were girls or women!

    *   **Answer:** The feminine gender refers to a **female** person or animal. (Female means "girl" or "woman").

3.  **The common gender refers to both \_\_ and \_\_ persons/animals.**

    *   This is asking: What kind of person or animal is "common gender"? Think about "teachers" from our story! They could be men or women.

    *   **Answer:** The common gender refers to both **male** and **female** persons/animals.

4.  **The neuter gender denotes a thing which is neither \_\_ nor \_\_.**

    *   This is asking: What kind of thing is "neuter"? Remember "house" from our story? It wasn't a boy or a girl.

    *   **Answer:** The neuter gender denotes a thing which is neither **male** nor **female**.

**Great job!** You have now filled in the blanks. Now you know what each gender mean! It's all about "boy," "girl," "both," or "neither"!
