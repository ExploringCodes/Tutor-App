Okay! We are still learning about "Gender" and keeping it fun, like we did before with the toys! Now we will look at this new information about different kinds of genders in English.

**What the new text says:**

It says there are four genders in English! Let's think about each one.

**1. Masculine Gender:**

*   This is like saying "boy" or "man." We use this for male people and animals.
*   **Imagine:** A superhero! A superhero like Superman is "masculine." We might say, "He is strong!"

**2. Feminine Gender:**

*   This is like saying "girl" or "woman." We use this for female people and animals.
*   **Imagine:** A princess! A princess like Cinderella is "feminine." We might say, "She is kind!"

**3. Common Gender:**

*   This is tricky! It means we don't know if it's a boy or a girl, *or* it could be both. These are words that can be boys or girls.
*   **Think of words like:** "Teacher," "Doctor," "Friend," or "Child." A teacher could be a man or a woman! A friend could be a boy or a girl!
*   **Story Time:** Imagine a doctor helps you feel better. You don't know if the doctor is a man or a woman until you see them! So, "doctor" is a "common gender" word.

**4. Neuter Gender:**

*   This means it's *not* a boy or a girl. We use this for things that aren't alive or don't have a gender.
*   **Think of things like:** a table, a car, a book, or a house.
*   **Imagine:** You have a cool car! You might say, "It is red!" The car isn't a boy or a girl, so we say "it."

**Important words to know:**

*   **Masculine:** (boy/man) - About males.
*   **Feminine:** (girl/woman) - About females.
*   **Common:** (shared) - Could be male or female.
*   **Neuter:** (neither) - Not male or female, usually things that aren't alive.

**Remember!** Like we talked about before, gender is also about how you feel inside. These "genders" are just how we use words in English! Keep being kind and respectful to everyone!
